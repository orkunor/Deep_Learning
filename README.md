Artificial intelligence (AI) plays an important role in todayâ€™s technological developments. One of the most exciting developments in this field is deep learning. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and is inspired by how the human brain works. It is an approach based on artificial neural networks that enables computers to learn from large data sets. By learning from large amounts of data, deep learning models can identify complex patterns and relationships, much like the human brain does. In this article, we will explore what deep learning is, how it works and its various application areas.
